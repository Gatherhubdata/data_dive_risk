##Â Helen's notebooks

These are predominantly exploratory data analysis for the tidied data and original Excel data. 

My aims were to:
 - understand the structure of the data
 - get insight into truly unique rows (not well explored)
 - reliability and consistency of individual rows - should we be using the data in those rows?
   - I identified some questions that we could ask of the data and generated a dataframe that flags whether particular rows are unreliable on particular issues
 - the summary notebook contains the latest results on row reliability
